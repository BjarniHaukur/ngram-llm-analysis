# Team Diary

## Week 36 (September 2 - September 8)
Project Manager: Bjarni

### Bjarni
- **Number of hours this week: 7**
- Writing the project plan
- Getting to know our group members
- Familiarizing myself with the paper in question (and other relevant papers)
- Contemplating what exactly it is we are supposed to be understanding

### Boti
- **Number of hours this week: 5**
- Reading the related materials
- Writing the project plan, assessment with Johan via e-mail
- Thinking about possible approaches

### Jonas
- **Number of hours this week: 6.5**
- Familiarizing with the group
- Reading https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.12034
- Most time was spent on composing a project plan.
- Did some research on N-grams and found this great resource for efficient N-grams which we could use for N-gram-statistics. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3302913: Handling Massive N-Gram Datasets Efficiently, https://github.com/jermp/tongrams.

### Felix
- **Number of hours this week: 5.5**
- My primary focus was on organizing the collaboration aspects of the project and aligning the individual skill sets of each group member. We developed a strategy outlining how we intended to work together as a team, along with the methods necessary for our approach.
- I conducted research for our project plan, focusing on how N-Gram statistics have been historically applied to AI. Using the Web of Science, I identified the most relevant sources and potential high-impact papers.
- I revised and converted bullet points into continuous sentences to enhance the overall readability and flow of the content.

### Group Meeting
- We held a meeting to discuss potential projects, reviewed all available topics, and reached a consensus on a common direction. Following this, we sent the necessary emails.
- During the meeting, we introduced ourselves, discussed our skills and initial thoughts, and briefly talked about the chosen project. Afterwards, we all read Nguyenâ€™s research paper.
- We developed the project plan in two stages: first, by establishing a clear structure, and then by highlighting the key points. Since we exceeded the two-page limit, we shortened sections on motivation and background, but kept these ideas for the final report.

### Peer Group Meeting
- We got in contact with the peer group and decided to set up a shared Discord Server. The first meeting was scheduled for the 9th of September.

### Supervisor Meeting
- We had a one-hour meeting to discuss our approaches and explore potential improvements to the project. We also reviewed the timeline for completing our tasks.
- Johan explained his choice of the N-Gram topic, highlighting its relevance to the explainability of transformers. He provided an example from the Swedish language, demonstrating how a single syllable can change the entire context.
- He also mentioned the possibility of acquiring resources from KTH to support our project.

## Week 37 (September 9 - September 15)
Project Manager: Bjarni

### Bjarni
- **Number of hours this week: TBD**
- Repurpose code from a similar project I had
    - BPETokenizer, MemmapDataset, project structure, sampling functions (sampling with temp, top_k sampling, nucleous sampling)
- Creating a small, workable, split of the TinyStories dataset
- Fitting A BPETokenizer to that split
    - Kind off similar to N-Gram
    - Reveals some "worrying" patterns in the data
    - "Once upon of time, there was a " is more common than "tree"

1. Literature Review on Transformer Models and N-gram Statistics
I conducted an in-depth literature review on transformer models, with a particular emphasis on their relationship with n-gram statistics. This involved analyzing recent research papers, articles, and case studies to understand how n-gram approaches are integrated within transformer architectures. The objective was to identify methodologies that could enhance our project's performance by incorporating these statistical techniques.
2. Attempting to Run an N-gram Statistics GitHub Library on MacBook
I attempted to implement an open-source GitHub library designed for n-gram statistics on my MacBook. During this process, I encountered issues related to processor incompatibility. After extensive troubleshooting, I consulted with **Jonas**, who confirmed that the library is not compatible with certain MacBook processors. This setback highlighted the need to either modify the library for compatibility or seek alternative solutions that are compatible with our hardware.
3. Studying Previous Work on Tokenizers by **Bjarni** and **Jonas**
I invested time in understanding the previous work done by Bjarni and Jonas on tokenizers. This involved reviewing their codebases, documentation, and any supplementary materials they provided in order to further enhance my knowledge regarding AI models and close potential knowledge gaps.

### Peer Group Meeting
- Discussed what exactly are we understanding about transformers with this method (e.g. describing language/dataset more than the transformer architecture)
- Set a time for weekly meetings
- We agreed have some results reproducing the paper's findings before setting goals that could be opposing each group
