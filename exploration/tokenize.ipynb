    "## Naive Tokenization using a fixed Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "We need tokenization to represent text as something we can put into our neural networks. This process turns the most common words into integers. These integers can then be embedded using one hot encoding (a very poor choice) or by training an embedding layer as we train our network (or use a pretrained one). For a fixed vocabulary of size VOCAB_SIZE and a neural network with input_dim INPUT_DIM, our embedding layer would learn VOCAB_SIZE embeddings of size INPUT_DIM.\n",

this thing appeard again tonight barnardo i have seen nothing marcellus horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it horatio tush tush twill not appear barnardo sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we two nights have seen horatio well sit we down and let us hear barnardo speak of this barnardo last night of all when yond same star thats westward from the pole had made his course tillume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one marcellus peace break thee off look where it comes again enter ghost barnardo in the same figure like the king thats dead marcellus thou art a scholar speak to it horatio barnardo looks it not like the king mark it horatio horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder barnardo it would be spoke to marcellus question it horatio horatio what art thou that usurpst this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak marcellus it is offended barnardo see it stalks away horatio stay speak speak i charge thee speak _exit ghost _ marcellus tis gone and will not answer barnardo how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you ont horatio before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes marcellus is it not like the king horatio as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he thambitious norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange marcellus thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch horatio in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state marcellus good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night jointlabourer with the day who ist that can inform me horatio that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dard to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seizd of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covnant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach int which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and rummage in the land barnardo i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars horatio a mote it is to trouble the minds eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen reenter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy countrys fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak _the cock crows _ stop it marcellus marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan horatio do if it will not stand barnardo tis here horatio tis here _exit ghost _ marcellus tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery barnardo it was about to speak when the cock crew horatio and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air thextravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation marcellus it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time horatio so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty marcellus lets dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently _exeunt _ scene ii elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant king though yet of hamlet our dear brothers death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen thimperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brothers death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephews purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and voltemand in that and all things will we show our duty king we doubt it nothing heartily farewell _exeunt voltemand and cornelius _ and now laertes whats the news with you you told us of some suit what ist laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon king have you your fathers leave what says polonius polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seald my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go king take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son hamlet _aside _ a little more than kin and less than kind king how is it that the clouds still hang on you hamlet not so my lord i am too much i the sun queen good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou knowst tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity hamlet ay madam it is common queen if it be why seems it so particular with thee hamlet seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forcd breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe king tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son queen let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg hamlet i shall in all my best obey you madam king why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforcd accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the kings rouse the heaven shall bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away _exeunt all but hamlet _ hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fixd his canon gainst selfslaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie ont oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months deadnay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor fathers body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mournd longer married with mine uncle my fathers brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo horatio hail to your lordship hamlet i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself horatio the same my lord and your poor servant ever hamlet sir my good friend ill change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus marcellus my good lord hamlet i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg horatio a truant disposition good my lord hamlet i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore well teach you to drink deep ere you depart horatio my lord i came to see your fathers funeral hamlet i prithee do not mock me fellowstudent i think it was to see my mothers wedding horatio indeed my lord it followd hard upon hamlet thrift thrift horatio the funeral bakd meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father horatio where my lord hamlet in my minds eye horatio horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king hamlet he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again horatio my lord i think i saw him yesternight hamlet saw who horatio my lord the king your father hamlet the king my father horatio season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you hamlet for gods love let me hear horatio two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounterd a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap√†pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes within his truncheons length whilst they distilld almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliverd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like hamlet but where was this marcellus my lord upon the platform where we watch hamlet did you not speak to it horatio my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanishd from our sight hamlet tis very strange horatio as i do live my honourd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it hamlet indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight marcellus and barnardo we do my lord hamlet armd say you both armd my lord hamlet from top to toe both my lord from head to foot hamlet then saw you not his face horatio o yes my lord he wore his beaver up hamlet what lookd he frowningly horatio a countenance more in sorrow than in anger hamlet pale or red horatio nay very pale hamlet and fixd his eyes upon you horatio most constantly hamlet i would i had been there horatio it would have much amazd you hamlet very like very like stayd it long horatio while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and barnardo longer longer horatio not when i sawt hamlet his beard was grizzled no horatio it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silverd hamlet i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again horatio i warrant you it will hamlet if it assume my noble fathers person ill speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceald this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve ill visit you all our duty to your honour hamlet your loves as mine to you farewell _exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo _ my fathers spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes _exit _ scene iii a room in poloniuss house enter laertes and ophelia laertes my necessaries are embarkd farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you ophelia do you doubt that laertes for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more ophelia no more but so laertes think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalud persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribd unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmasterd importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosd and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near ophelia i shall theffect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puffd and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede laertes o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave polonius yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayd for there my blessing with you _laying his hand on laertess head _ and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportiond thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each newhatchd unfledgd comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that thopposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgement costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee laertes most humbly do i take my leave my lord polonius the time invites you go your servants tend laertes farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you ophelia tis in my memory lockd and you yourself shall keep the key of it laertes farewell _exit _ polonius what ist ophelia he hath said to you ophelia so please you something touching the lord hamlet polonius marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth ophelia he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me polonius affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them ophelia i do not know my lord what i should think polonius marry ill teach you think yourself a baby that you have taen these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus youll tender me a fool ophelia my lord he hath importund me with love in honourable fashion polonius ay fashion you may call it go to go to ophelia and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven polonius ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is amaking you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look tot i charge you come your ways ophelia i shall obey my lord _exeunt _ scene iv the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus hamlet the air bites shrewdly it is very cold horatio it is a nipping and an eager air hamlet what hour now horatio i think it lacks of twelve marcellus no it is struck horatio indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk _a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within _ what does this mean my lord hamlet the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge horatio is it a custom hamlet ay marry ist and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honourd in the breach than the observance this heavyheaded revel east and west makes us traducd and taxd of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their oergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much oerleavens the form of plausive mannersthat these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or fortunes star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal horatio look my lord it comes enter ghost hamlet angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comst in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do _ghost beckons hamlet _ horatio it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone marcellus look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it horatio no by no means hamlet it will not speak then will i follow it horatio do not my lord hamlet why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pins fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again ill follow it horatio what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles oer his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath hamlet it waves me still go on ill follow thee marcellus you shall not go my lord hamlet hold off your hands horatio be ruld you shall not go hamlet my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lions nerve _ghost beckons _ still am i calld unhand me gentlemen _breaking free from them _ by heaven ill make a ghost of him that lets me i say awaygo on ill follow thee _exeunt ghost and hamlet _ horatio he waxes desperate with imagination marcellus lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him horatio have after to what issue will this come marcellus something is rotten in the state of denmark horatio heaven will direct it marcellus nay lets follow him _exeunt _ scene v a more remote part of the castle enter ghost and hamlet hamlet whither wilt thou lead me speak ill go no further ghost mark me hamlet i will ghost my hour is almost come when i to sulphrous and tormenting flames must render up myself hamlet alas poor ghost ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold hamlet speak i am bound to hear ghost so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear hamlet what ghost i am thy fathers spirit doomd for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confind to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purgd away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love hamlet o god ghost revenge his foul and most unnatural murder hamlet murder ghost murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural hamlet haste me to knowt that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge ghost i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abusd but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy fathers life now wears his crown hamlet o my prophetic soul mine uncle ghost ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seducewon to his shameful lust the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was

these notes reynaldo reynaldo i will my lord polonius you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behaviour reynaldo my lord i did intend it polonius marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part himdo you mark this reynaldo reynaldo ay very well my lord polonius and in part him but you may say not well but ift be he i mean hes very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty reynaldo as gaming my lord polonius ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far reynaldo my lord that would dishonour him polonius faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault reynaldo but my good lord polonius wherefore should you do this reynaldo ay my lord i would know that polonius marry sir heres my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soild i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assurd he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country reynaldo very good my lord polonius and then sir does he this he doeswhat was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave reynaldo at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman polonius at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or tother day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there oertook ins rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale _videlicet_ a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not reynaldo my lord i have polonius god b wi you fare you well reynaldo good my lord polonius observe his inclination in yourself reynaldo i shall my lord polonius and let him ply his music reynaldo well my lord polonius farewell _exit reynaldo _ enter ophelia how now ophelia whats the matter ophelia alas my lord i have been so affrighted polonius with what in the name of god ophelia my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbracd no hat upon his head his stockings fould ungartred and downgyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me polonius mad for thy love ophelia my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it polonius what said he ophelia he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raisd a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me polonius come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late ophelia no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me polonius that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgement i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love _exeunt _ scene ii a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants king welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlets transformation so i call it since nor thexterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his fathers death that thus hath put him so much from thunderstanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbourd to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opend lies within our remedy queen good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a kings remembrance rosencrantz both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty guildenstern we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded king thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern queen thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is guildenstern heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him queen ay amen _exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern

liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath usd to dothat i have found the very cause of hamlets lunacy king o speak of that that do i long to hear polonius give first admittance to thambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast king thyself do grace to them and bring them in _exit polonius _ he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your sons distemper queen i doubt it is no other but the main his fathers death and our oerhasty marriage king well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway voltemand most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephews levies which to him appeard to be a preparation gainst the polack but better lookd into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grievd that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give thassay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown _gives a paper _ that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down king it likes us well and at our more considerd time well read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your welltook labour go to your rest at night well feast together most welcome home _exeunt voltemand and cornelius _ polonius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what ist but to be nothing else but mad but let that go queen more matter with less art polonius madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughterhave whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise _reads _ _to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified ophelia_ thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear _reads _ _these in her excellent

machine is to him hamlet _ this in obedience hath my daughter showd me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear king but how hath she receivd his love polonius what do you think of me king as of a man faithful and honourable polonius i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceivd it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or tablebook or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for king do you think tis this queen it may be very likely polonius hath there been such a time id fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it provd otherwise king not that i know polonius take this from this if this be otherwise _points to his head and shoulder _ if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre king how may we try it further polonius you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby queen so he does indeed polonius at such a time ill loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason falln thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters king we will try it enter hamlet reading queen but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading polonius away i do beseech you both away ill board him presently o give me leave _exeunt king queen and attendants _ how does my good lord hamlet hamlet well godamercy polonius do you know me my lord hamlet excellent well you are a fishmonger polonius not i my lord hamlet then i would you were so honest a man polonius honest my lord hamlet ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand polonius thats very true my lord hamlet for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter polonius i have my lord hamlet let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look tot polonius how say you by that _aside _ still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this ill speak to him again what do you read my lord hamlet words words words polonius what is the matter my lord hamlet between who polonius i mean the matter that you read my lord hamlet slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward polonius _aside _ though this be madness yet there is method int will you walk out of the air my lord hamlet into my grave polonius indeed that is out o the air _aside _ how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you hamlet you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life polonius fare you well my lord hamlet these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern polonius you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is rosencrantz _to polonius _ god save you sir _exit polonius _ guildenstern my honoured lord rosencrantz my most dear lord hamlet my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both rosencrantz as the indifferent children of the earth guildenstern happy in that we are not overhappy on fortunes cap we are not the very button hamlet nor the soles of her shoe rosencrantz neither my lord hamlet then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours guildenstern faith her privates we hamlet in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet whats the news rosencrantz none my lord but that the worlds grown honest hamlet then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither guildenstern prison my lord hamlet denmarks a prison rosencrantz then is the world one hamlet a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst rosencrantz we think not so my lord hamlet why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison rosencrantz why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind hamlet o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams guildenstern which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream hamlet a dream itself is but a shadow rosencrantz truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow hamlet then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretchd heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and guildenstern well wait upon you hamlet no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore rosencrantz to visit you my lord no other occasion hamlet beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak guildenstern what should we say my lord hamlet why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you rosencrantz to what end my lord hamlet that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no rosencrantz _to guildenstern _ what say you hamlet _aside _ nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off guildenstern my lord we were sent for hamlet i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so rosencrantz my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts hamlet why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me rosencrantz to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service hamlet he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort what players are they rosencrantz even those you were wont to take such delight inthe tragedians of the city hamlet how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways rosencrantz i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation hamlet do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed rosencrantz no indeed they are not hamlet how comes it do they grow rusty rosencrantz nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aerie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither hamlet what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession rosencrantz faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question hamlet ist possible guildenstern o there has been much throwing about of brains hamlet do the boys carry it away rosencrantz ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too hamlet it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out _flourish of trumpets within _ guildenstern there are the players hamlet gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my unclefather and auntmother are deceived guildenstern in what my dear lord hamlet i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius polonius well be with you gentlemen hamlet hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts rosencrantz happily hes the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child hamlet i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir for a monday morning twas so indeed polonius my lord i have news to tell you hamlet my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome polonius the actors are come hither my lord hamlet buzz buzz polonius upon my honour hamlet then came each actor on his ass polonius the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragicalcomicalhistoricalpastoral scene individable or poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men hamlet o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou polonius what treasure had he my lord hamlet why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well polonius _aside _ still on my daughter hamlet am i not i th right old jephthah polonius if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well hamlet nay that follows not polonius what follows then my lord hamlet why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgement comes enter four or five players you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend thy face is valancd since i saw thee last comst thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress byr lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome well een tot like french falconers fly at anything we see well have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first player what speech my lord hamlet i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it wasas i received it and others whose judgements in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see _the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast _ it is not so it begins with pyrrhus _the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bakd and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus oersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks _ so proceed you polonius fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first player _anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matchd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword thunnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i thair to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new awork and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forgd for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends _ polonius this is too long hamlet it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba first player _but who o who had seen the mobled queen _ hamlet the mobled queen polonius thats good mobled queen is good first player _run barefoot up and down threatning the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all oerteemed loins a blanket in thalarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd gainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncd but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods _ polonius look where he has not turnd his colour and has tears ins eyes pray you no more hamlet tis well ill have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live polonius my lord i will use them according to their desert hamlet gods bodikin man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in polonius come sirs hamlet follow him friends well hear a play tomorrow _exeunt polonius with all the players but the first _ dost thou hear me old friend can you play _the murder of gonzago_ first player ay my lord hamlet well hat tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert int could you not first player ay my lord hamlet very well follow that lord and look you mock him not _exit first player _ _to rosencrantz and guildenstern_ my good friends ill leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore rosencrantz good my lord _exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern _ hamlet ay so god b wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wand tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddymettled rascal peak like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damnd defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i th throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain oh vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall acursing like a very drab a scullion fie upont foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power tassume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me ill have grounds more relative than this the plays the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king _exit _ act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern king and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy rosencrantz he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak guildenstern nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state queen did he receive you well rosencrantz most like a gentleman guildenstern but with much forcing of his disposition rosencrantz niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply queen did you assay him to any pastime rosencrantz madam it so fell out that certain players we oerraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him polonius tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter king with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclind good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights rosencrantz we shall my lord _exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern _ king sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behavd ift be thaffliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for queen i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours ophelia madam i wish it may _exit queen _ polonius ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves _to ophelia _ read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much provd that with devotions visage and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself king _aside _ o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden polonius i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord _exeunt king and polonius _ enter hamlet hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to dieto sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dreamay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of disprizd love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins rememberd ophelia good my lord how does your honour for this many a day hamlet i humbly thank you well well well ophelia my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver i pray you now receive them

you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ophelia could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty hamlet ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once ophelia indeed my lord you made me believe so hamlet you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not ophelia i was the more deceived hamlet get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your father ophelia at home my lord hamlet let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but ins own house farewell ophelia o help him you sweet heavens hamlet if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny

tune and harsh that unmatchd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me thave seen what i have seen see what i see enter king and polonius king love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you ont polonius it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and ill be placd so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think king it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go _exeunt _ scene ii a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players hamlet speak the

hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it first player i warrant your honour hamlet be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen playand heard others praise and that highlynot to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first player i hope we have reformd that indifferently with us sir hamlet o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready _exeunt players _ enter

by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirrd up king o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them laertes and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come king break not your sleeps for that you must not

otherwise will you be ruld by me laertes ay my lord so you will not oerrule me to a peace king to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident laertes my lord i will be ruld the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ king it falls right you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege laertes what part is that my lord king a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy ive seen myself and servd against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been incorpsd and deminaturd with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did laertes a norman wast king a norman laertes upon my life lamord king the very same laertes i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation king he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposd them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him now out of this laertes what out of this my lord king laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart laertes why ask you this king not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o thulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words laertes to cut his throat i th church king no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good

gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father laertes i will dot and for that purpose ill anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death this is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death king lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see well make a solemn wager on your

earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many suchlike ases of great charge that on the view and know of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shrivingtime allowd horatio how was this seald hamlet why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my fathers signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of the other subscribd it gavet thimpression placd it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our seafight and what to this was sequent thou knowst already horatio so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot

gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt

head osric i thank your lordship tis very hot hamlet no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly osric it is indifferent cold my lord indeed hamlet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my

hamlet i beseech you remember _hamlet moves him to put on his hat _ osric nay in good faith for mine ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see hamlet sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy tharithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more osric your lordship speaks most infallibly of him hamlet the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath osric sir horatio ist not possible to understand in another tongue you will dot sir really hamlet what imports the nomination of this gentleman osric of laertes horatio his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent hamlet of him sir osric i know you are not ignorant hamlet i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir osric you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is hamlet i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself osric i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed hamlet whats his weapon osric rapier and dagger hamlet thats two of his weapons but well osric the king sir hath wagerd with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit hamlet what call you the carriages horatio i knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done osric the carriages sir are the hangers hamlet the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish why is this all imponed as you call it osric the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer hamlet how if i answer no osric i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial hamlet sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him if i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits osric shall i redeliver you een so hamlet to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will osric i commend my duty to your lordship hamlet yours yours _exit osric _ he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else fors turn horatio this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head hamlet he did comply with his dug before he suckd it thus has he and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out enter a lord lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time hamlet i am constant to my purposes they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now lord the king and queen and all are coming down hamlet in happy time lord the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play hamlet she well instructs me _exit lord _ horatio you will lose this wager my lord hamlet i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter horatio nay good my lord hamlet it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman horatio if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit hamlet not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what ist to leave betimes enter king queen laertes lords osric and attendants with foils c king come hamlet come and take this hand from me _the king puts laertess hand into hamlets _ hamlet give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardont as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punishd with sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness wast hamlet wrongd laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be taen away and when hes not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness ift be so hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd his madness is poor hamlets enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposd evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow oer the house and hurt my brother laertes i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honour i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungord but till that time i do receive your offerd love like love and will not wrong it hamlet i embrace it freely and will this brothers wager frankly play give us the foils come on laertes come one for me hamlet ill be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i th darkest night stick fiery off indeed laertes you mock me sir hamlet no by this hand king give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager hamlet very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o the weaker side king i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is betterd we have therefore odds laertes this is too heavy let me see another hamlet this likes me well these foils have all a length _they prepare to play _ osric ay my good lord king set me the stoups of wine upon that table if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlets better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that
